Starting from the challenge of glove.

My general method of learning anything is to pop up questions and then search for them across the web. I also contrast like things and search by assuming claims and counter-claims.

- Exploring wasm ecosystem

- Watching RustConf 2019 - From Electron, to Wasm, to Rust https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLzFJenzBng

- Realizing rust has good support and cross-community

Motivation is established.

Any mention of chapters in following refers to "the book" at https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

- Getting a mental taste of syntax: https://cheats.rs/

- Skim reviewing RustConf 2019 video again, this has been pinned for weeks I've been through it several times by now.

- Auditing several published crates and the conventions for structure: sigp/lighthouse, ethers-rs, ethereum, ethers_contract, swc-project/swc

- Looking up macros

- Jumping across https://docs.rs/ and https://crates.io/ and repos in context of above

By this time I've gone through Chapter 1, 2 (skimming), 3, 5, 7, 10 without realizing it's from the book

- Start reading http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2018/09/18/falling-in-love-with-rust/

- Setting up evmtx

- From an article, jumping off to Chapter 4, reading and understanding it very thoughtfully

- Skimming through Chapter 19.2, 19.3

- Skimming through `rust-lang/rust`
